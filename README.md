# 3DComputerGraphicsPaperPresentation
A project to implement the paper : An approximate image-space approach
for interactive refraction C. Wyman (2005).

This project was done together with [@JonathanBrouwer](https://github.com/JonathanBrouwer), and is a copy of the original project, The original repo seems to be lost to the sands of time...
